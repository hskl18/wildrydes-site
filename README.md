### Architecture

The application utilizes the following AWS services:
- **AWS Lambda**: For running backend code without provisioning or managing servers.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Provides a RESTful API that is integrated with the Lambda functions.
- **AWS Amplify**: Used for hosting and deploying the web application frontend.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Managed NoSQL database service for storing application data.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Provides authentication and user management for the web application.
